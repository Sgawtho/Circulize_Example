# Chord Diagram Example Using Circlize in R

This is an R script for producing Chord Diagrams using the 'circulize' package in R Studio. 


The script includes some common ways to clean and prep the data for a chord diagram with a cube root function to better fit the data.
Chord diagrams are an excellent way to illustrate complex network relationships and a useful alternative when the data is too complex for spatial maps.

This example uses the following packages: `circlize`, `reshape2`, `dplyr`
